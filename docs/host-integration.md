# Host integration

For installation, use the [host quick start](quickstart.md). For containers, use
[the sandbox guide](sandbox.md). This page covers launch options and behavior.

[Diagram source](assets/host-integration.puml)

Managed Codex and Claude channels submit messages automatically while their
processes run. Ordinary [MCP](mcp.md) requires inbox checks; it does not wake an
idle agent. Neither mode listens after its process exits.

## Claude Code

Use the [dedicated config and launch command](quickstart.md#3-start-claude-code).
It enables `--claude-channel --auto-listen` and requires interactive channel
consent. Keep the process running.

- `--auto-listen` registers after MCP initialization. Reserve that config for the
  owning session: even an inventory probe that initializes it attempts registration.
- Default MCP and channels without auto-listen stay passive until a messaging or
  `listen` call. Auto-listen requires channel mode.
- On registration failure, inspect stderr / `listener_status`, then retry `listen`
  or restart. Duplicate IDs never displace the owner.
- Account/provider, host version and organization policy determine channel support.
  The development flag does not override policy. On tested Claude 2.1.272 it is
  ignored in `-p` mode; tools work but notifications do not. Use an interactive session.
  This repository is not an approved production channel plugin.

The adapter advertises `experimental["claude/channel"]` and emits
`notifications/claude/channel`, without permission relay. It requires the
`initialize` / `initialized` handshake; stateless discovery is rejected.
A successful notification write does not prove Claude read it. Only a broker-confirmed
explicit acknowledgment establishes acknowledgment; replies do not imply it.

## Codex terminal

After the [host build](quickstart.md#1-build-and-start-the-broker), start the broker,
then choose one command:

```sh
# New conversation
./collab-codex --agent-id codex-1 --socket /tmp/collab-ai.sock --terminal -- \
  -C /absolute/path/to/project

# Resume a managed or ordinary Codex conversation (close the old owner first)
./collab-codex --agent-id codex-1 --socket /tmp/collab-ai.sock --terminal -- \
  resume SESSION_ID -C /absolute/path/to/project

# Or fork it into a new conversation
./collab-codex --agent-id codex-1 --socket /tmp/collab-ai.sock --terminal -- \
  fork SESSION_ID -C /absolute/path/to/project
```

`resume --last` selects the last conversation. Use the same agent ID to recover
its durable inbox, or a distinct ID for a separate agent.

| Rule | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Launcher options | Before `--` |
| Codex options | After `--`; forwarded unchanged, except reserved `--remote` |
| Saved permissions | Codex 0.156.1 rejects remote-resume `--sandbox` / `--ask-for-approval` overrides |
| One conversation per launcher | Exit and relaunch instead of `/new`, `/resume` or `/fork` |
| Login/config/`exec` | Use the native `codex` command |
| Extra control session | Use a distinct broker agent ID; it does not share conversation context |

The normal Codex UI handles prompts and approvals. Listening starts after successful
start/resume/fork and any folder-trust prompt. Failed broker registration terminates
the session; exiting stops the proxy and App Server. No running terminal/desktop
session is attached. The CLI must support `--remote unix://PATH` (tested: 0.156.1).

For a socket in the current directory, use `--socket "$PWD/collab-ai.sock"`.
A socket file can be stale; confirm `collab status` reports ready.

<details>
<summary>Runtime configuration and transport</summary>

The CLI's `--remote` connection uses WebSocket framing over a private Unix socket
(mode-0700 directory, removed on exit). The broker still uses UDS; no TCP listener
or global configuration change is introduced.

A required session-local `collab_runtime` MCP server relays tools to the proxy's
existing listener, without another broker connection. Its configuration is injected
into start/resume/fork and regenerated on launch. The server name is reserved;
caller-supplied `config["mcp_servers.collab_runtime"]` is rejected. An independent
manual adapter must not claim the same inbox. Legacy `collab_*` dynamic tools use
the same listener. Resume/fork retain developer instructions unless explicitly replaced.

Cancellation sends SIGTERM to Codex so npm launchers can forward it to their native
child, with a two-second fallback timeout. Codex owns session selection, history
loading and argument parsing; forwarding flags does not guarantee every workflow.

App Server diagnostics appear after the terminal exits, keeping the live UI intact.
Only the latest 64 KiB is retained; truncated output is marked.

### Codex soft cap

Create a budget once, then reuse it across launches/resumes:

```sh
collab budget create my-task --tokens 100000
collab budget status my-task --json
collab-codex --agent-id codex-1 --budget my-task --terminal -- resume SESSION_ID
```

One budget supports **one managed Codex launcher**, not Claude or shared agents.
No budget option means uncapped. The inline alternative is
`--token-cap 100000 --budget-file /absolute/path/task-budget.json`; create its
parent first and do not combine it with `--budget`.

**Soft limit, not a security boundary:** delayed/missing reports and remote work
can overshoot without a proven maximum. Unreported subagent/auxiliary usage is not
covered. An agent with write access can modify budget files or bypass the launcher.
Subscription login and native approvals are unchanged.

Budgets live in `~/.local/state/collab-ai/budgets`; `COLLAB_BUDGET_DIR` overrides it
for both launcher and commands. Keep the same budget/files outside repositories.
`create` never resets an existing budget, and exhausted budgets cannot relaunch.
Root-disk-only budgets are lost when that disk is replaced.

<details>
<summary>Accounting, stopping and protected status</summary>

Status reports the cap, observed spend, remaining allocation, overshoot, last report
time and errors, without a broker/model connection. Unknown usage is not zero;
an old timestamp can mean idle time or delayed reports. Counts are native tokens,
not dollars, subscription balances or billing audits.

The supervisor persists cumulative `thread/tokenUsage/updated.totalTokens` high-water
marks per thread and sums them, without re-adding cached/reasoning subtotals. Duplicate
reports do not add spend. A decreased counter stops the session without refund.
Resumed history is counted; forked IDs count separately, including reported history.
One launcher locks the file; cap changes are rejected. A new file is a separate budget.

At the observed cap, new operator requests and peer turns are rejected. The proxy
requests `turn/interrupt`, waits two seconds, then terminates the App Server process
group (SIGTERM, SIGKILL after another two seconds). Late reports are recorded;
unacknowledged durable messages remain recoverable. Pending work is not retried.
Malformed usage or persistence failure also stops the session. Reconcile unknown
usage before starting a new budget; crashes/storage failure may lose the latest report.
Tests are offline fixtures, not live subscription-spend validation.

A protected launcher can expose `--budget-status-socket /absolute/path/status.sock`.
Its existing parent must belong to the launcher and not be group/world writable.
Mount only that directory read-only into dev, keeping the launcher, budget and admin
outside dev's filesystem/process access. Query with:

```sh
collab budget status NAME --socket /mounted/status.sock --json
```

This endpoint cannot create/reset caps or report usage; a missing endpoint is an
error, never a fallback to local storage. Protection depends on the external launcher;
see the [experimental boundary and limitations](budget-boundary.md).

<summary>App Server protocol, listener behavior and validation</summary>

## Codex App Server clients

Build `go build -o collab-codex ./cmd/codex`. An App Server client can launch:

```sh
./collab-codex --agent-id codex-1 --socket /tmp/collab-ai.sock
```

The executable launches `codex app-server --listen stdio://` and speaks the App
Server protocol on stdin/stdout. It is a proxy for an operator-owned client, not
a terminal chat UI. Use `--codex /absolute/path/to/codex` to choose the executable.

The client initializes with `capabilities.experimentalApi: true`, sends
`initialized`, and selects one thread with `thread/start`, `thread/resume`, or
`thread/fork`. The proxy adds the required runtime MCP configuration. The caller's
existing dynamic tools, sandbox, approval policy, and other thread parameters are
preserved. Legacy `collab_` names remain reserved for restored collaboration
tools. A failed lifecycle request can be retried; selecting a second conversation
needs a new proxy process. Existing running desktop conversations are not attached
or controlled by this integration.

Operator request IDs must not start with `collab-`; that namespace is reserved
for injected requests. Replies arriving after an injected request times out are
consumed internally. Operator responses to host approval requests pass through
regardless of their ID.

After the successful thread lifecycle response is forwarded to the client, the
proxy activates listening automatically. Its internal MCP tool discovery stays
passive. Start normal operator work using `turn/start`. Incoming frames enter
the managed thread with:

```json
{
  "method": "turn/start",
  "params": {
    "threadId": "<managed-thread-id>",
    "input": [],
    "toolOutput": {"name": "collab_receive", "output": "<encoded peer frame>"}
  }
}
```

The host contract queues external tool output during active work and starts a
turn when idle. The proxy never promotes peer content to user instructions and
never turns an API response into an agent acknowledgment. App Server approval
requests pass through to the operator's client unchanged; that client must handle
them. Collaboration peers cannot answer them through the broker.

## Status, fallback, and shutdown

One listener owns the broker connection and consumes its frames. Messaging tools
share that owner. `receive`/`wait` drain a separate bounded copy, so they cannot
steal a frame from host submission. Only message and error frames are submitted;
acknowledgment events remain in the fallback inbox to avoid endless wake cycles.
`wait_reply` selectively consumes one correlated reply/error from that same copy,
preserving host submission and unrelated frames. It is exposed as
`wait_reply` through `collab_runtime` (or restored legacy `collab_wait_reply`).
See [correlated replies](correlated-replies.md)
for outcomes and deduplication across host notifications and tool results.
The runtime removes a copied peer message only after the broker confirms this
receiving session's explicit `agent_acknowledged`. Successful host submission,
acknowledgment writes, and receipts from other sessions cannot remove it. An
already acknowledged reply may therefore be absent from a later `wait_reply`.

Receipt frames are bounded diagnostic history. Under frame or byte pressure,
the oldest receipts are evicted first; an incoming receipt is dropped if only
protected messages/errors remain. `receipts_dropped` is a cumulative counter in
`listener_status` and inbox results, including `wait_reply`. It is not a complete
receipt ledger; a missing receipt is not proof of failed delivery. Unacknowledged
messages and broker errors are never evicted to make room for receipts.

For healthy host delivery of acknowledgment-capable messages, periodic `receive`
drains are unnecessary. Use `receive` for diagnostics, broker receipt inspection,
legacy messages without acknowledgments, and recovery when Claude ignores a
notification. Message and error backlogs remain bounded and can still overflow
if nobody handles them.

`listener_status` returns `inactive`, `listening_delivery_unconfirmed`,
`disconnected`, or `stopped`, the broker session ID, submission count, last
submitted message ID, buffered frame/byte counts, receipt eviction count, and any error. `manual_check_required` stays true: neither
host's write response proves conversation exposure. These fields do not change
after a successful exchange and do not require continuous polling. Verify each tracked message
through its correlated `accepted`, `adapter_received`, and explicit
`agent_acknowledged` events. Acknowledgment means the agent considered the context,
not that it completed a task.

The broker client's inbox and listener copy each allow 256 frames / 4 MiB.
Receipts count toward the copy limit but are evicted under pressure. A protected
message/error overflow, a failed host submission, or an
established broker disconnect stops the listener, reports a possible gap in
status, and logs it to stderr.
Unconsumed copied frames remain readable until process exit. There is no silent
reconnect. Restart obtains a new broker session and loses in-memory frames;
accepted durable messages without agent acknowledgment replay to the same
logical ID on v3. Other history and ephemeral frames are not replayed. Initial
connection failures can be retried. Deduplicate stable IDs before repeating work.

The App Server proxy accepts host frames up to 32 MiB to accommodate large
plugin inventories. This does not change the broker's 1 MiB peer-frame limit.

Host submissions have a five-second deadline. Waiting tools use the existing
30-second maximum. Cancellation closes a potentially partial host write; EOF or
shutdown closes the managed process and releases inbox ownership. The production
listener waits on events, without polling the database.

## Validation and host references

`go test -race ./... -timeout=30s` covers the wire contract, concurrency, explicit
acknowledgments, retained fallback, inactive discovery, foreign-thread tool calls,
approval pass-through, unavailable hosts, overflow, and cancellation. Fake-host
tests cannot establish whether a particular installed host actually wakes.

The dynamic-tool response shape is checked against Codex 0.154.0's generated
`DynamicToolCallResponse` schema: `success` and `contentItems`, with text entries
using `type: "inputText"` and `text`. Tests exercise the full tool handler path,
validation failures, RPC errors, and late replies after cancellation.

The [recorded live handoff](host-live-demo.md) demonstrates all four cases on
Claude Code 2.1.272 and Codex CLI 0.154.0, with message, conversation, broker
session, and explicit acknowledgment identities.

The [automatic terminal lifecycle run](managed-comms-live-demo.md) records
Codex CLI 0.156.1 and the observed Claude organization-policy blocker.
