# Host quick start

**Outside the sandbox only.** Sandbox users have preinstalled tools and should use
[the README](../README.md#set-up-a-sandbox).

You need macOS/Linux, Git, Go 1.25+, and installed, signed-in Codex and Claude Code.
Codex integration was tested with 0.156.1. Claude needs channel consent and an
account/organization that permits channels; otherwise use [manual MCP](mcp.md).

## 1. Build and start the broker

Terminal 1:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/makarski/collab-ai.git
cd collab-ai
go build -o broker ./cmd/broker
go build -o collab-codex ./cmd/codex
go build -o collab-mcp ./cmd/mcp
go build -o collab ./cmd/collab
pwd  # use this absolute directory in the configuration below
COLLAB_SOCKET_PATH=/tmp/collab-ai.sock COLLAB_DB_PATH="$PWD/collab-ai.db" ./broker
```

Leave it running. If you already have a broker, reuse it or choose another socket
in **every** command/config. Keep its database for message recovery.

## 2. Start Codex

Terminal 2, from the collab-ai checkout:

```sh
./collab-codex --agent-id codex-1 --socket /tmp/collab-ai.sock --terminal -- \
  -C /absolute/path/to/your/project
```

Complete Codex's trust prompt and start a conversation. Listening is automatic;
use its `collab_runtime` tools. Do not register another adapter as `codex-1`.
[Resume, fork and caps](host-integration.md#codex-terminal).

## 3. Start Claude Code

Save this as a dedicated `mcp.json` outside the project; replace `command` with
the absolute path to the binary built in step 1:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "collab": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/collab-ai/collab-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--agent-id", "claude-1",
        "--socket", "/tmp/collab-ai.sock",
        "--claude-channel", "--auto-listen"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Terminal 3:

```sh
cd /absolute/path/to/your/project
claude --strict-mcp-config --mcp-config /absolute/path/to/mcp.json \
  --dangerously-load-development-channels server:collab
```

Accept channel consent. Keep this session open; another session needs a different
agent ID. [Channel troubleshooting](host-integration.md#claude-code).

## 4. Check both directions

Terminal 4, from the collab-ai checkout:

```sh
./collab status --socket /tmp/collab-ai.sock
./collab dashboard --socket /tmp/collab-ai.sock
```

Expect `Broker: ready` and both IDs connected. Ask Claude:

> Send codex-1 “Reply with pong”. Codex should acknowledge the message and reply
> with `in_reply_to` set to its ID. Acknowledge the pong without replying again.

Both conversations should receive messages without reminders. A reply does not
implicitly acknowledge a message. Connection status alone does not prove delivery.
Point both agents at the [collaboration skill](skills/collab-ai/SKILL.md) and agree
file ownership before concurrent edits.

## Watch, stop, and return

`q` closes the dashboard only. Exit agents, then Ctrl+C the broker to stop.
Restart with the same database and agent IDs for unacknowledged message recovery;
resume the agent conversation separately for its history.
