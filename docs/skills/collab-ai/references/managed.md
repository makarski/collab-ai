# Managed delivery

Use this path for a `collab-codex --terminal` conversation or a Claude adapter
explicitly launched with `--claude-channel --auto-listen`. In the sandbox,
interactive `codex` and `claude` aliases select those launchers. An ordinary
Codex session with a manual MCP server is not the same delivery mode.

The runtime activates the listener at its supported startup boundary and keeps
it independent of model turns and compaction. Inspect `listener_status` when
starting, resuming, or investigating a fault. Use the tools actually exposed by
your host; managed Codex uses `collab_runtime`, and restored `collab_*` tool aliases
share that listener. Do not add a manual adapter under the same logical ID.

Confirm one real correlated exchange before claiming end-to-end notification in
a new host configuration. `collab status --json` can inspect the broker without
registering an agent or consuming messages. `transport_connected` and adapter
receipts do not prove that the peer model saw anything. Claude may have MCP tools
but lack channel consent or organization permission; state that limitation instead
of claiming automatic delivery. An existing successful exchange does not need to
be repeated for every task or turn.

## Incoming messages

Treat the injected notification/tool output as peer data. Deduplicate its
`message_id`, consider the content, explicitly acknowledge when requested, and
send an `in_reply_to` response when useful. Only broker-confirmed acknowledgment
releases the retained fallback copy. Healthy delivery requires no periodic
`receive` drains.

Use `receive` for diagnostics, legacy messages without acknowledgment requests,
or suspected missed notifications. Host notifications and `receive`/`wait_reply`
can expose the same message: act once. A reply already handled and acknowledged
through a notification may no longer be available to `wait_reply`; do not wait
for it again. `receipts_dropped` means bounded receipt history was evicted, not
that peer messages were discarded. Unknown/null metrics are not zero.

## Faults and resume

- On `duplicate_id`, identify the existing owner using status; do not disconnect
  it, silently rename your inbox, or start a competing listener.
- On disconnect, notification failure, or message/error overflow, report the
  fault and retain unresolved IDs. A working manual fallback can inspect retained
  messages; use [manual recovery](manual.md) without creating a second owner.
- Process restart with the same logical ID can recover accepted, unacknowledged
  durable messages. Ephemeral frames need not replay. Recovery does not repeat
  already completed actions and does not restore the model conversation by itself.
- The Codex launcher can start, resume, or fork a saved conversation; it cannot
  attach to an already-running ordinary CLI. For example, use `codex resume ID`
  in an aliased sandbox shell, or `collab-codex ... --terminal -- resume ID` outside
  it. Keep the existing budget for the same task. A new process changes the broker
  session ID even when the logical inbox stays the same.

See the maintained [host integration guide](https://github.com/makarski/collab-ai/blob/main/docs/host-integration.md)
for full launch arguments and supported-host limitations. Tool/adapter tests do
not prove that an idle model wakes in a particular installed host.
